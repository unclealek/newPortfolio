## Technical Analysis

### Cyclic Patterns
1. **Short-term cycles**: Spanning 3-5 years, with periods of growth often followed by stabilization or decline.
2. **Long-term cycles**: Approximately 10-15 years, aligning with shifts in farming methods and external factors.

### Statistical Distribution
- Positive skewness (**10.14**) indicates frequent low-yield years offset by occasional, exceptionally high yields.

---

## Additional Context

### Historical Influences
- During the 1960s and 1970s, global agricultural policies prioritized food crops over fiber crops, which may have contributed to lower yields.
- The Green Revolution (1960s-1980s) had limited initial impact on Abaca farming, but subsequent adaptation of its principles boosted yields in the 1990s and beyond.

### Regional Comparisons
- The Philippines, as the leading producer, saw the most significant yield improvements due to targeted government programs and research initiatives.
- Other regions, like Latin America, have seen modest gains, often hindered by inconsistent resource allocation.

### Sustainability Aspects
- High-yielding years often correlate with heavy resource use. There is a growing need to balance productivity with sustainable practices, including soil conservation and water management.

## Implications and Recommendations

### Production Planning
1. **Risk Management**:
   - Develop buffer stocks during high-yield periods to mitigate future shortfalls.
   - Monitor yield trends using predictive analytics for better planning.
2. **Agricultural Practices**:
   - Focus on stabilizing yields by investing in sustainable farming methods.
   - Enhance adaptability to climatic and market fluctuations.

### Economic Impact
1. **Market Dynamics**:
   - High yields in recent decades have reduced price volatility but increased dependency on stable supply chains.
   - Investing in storage infrastructure can help mitigate market disruptions during yield fluctuations.
2. **Export Potential**:
   - Improved yields position Abaca as a competitive export, especially for countries like the Philippines and Ecuador.

### Research Priorities
1. **Investigation Areas**:
   - Factors behind peak yields in recent decades.
   - Impact of environmental and technological variables on yield stability.
2. **Data Collection**:
   - Implement detailed monitoring systems for climatic, soil, and farming data.
   - Explore correlations between technology adoption and yield improvements.
